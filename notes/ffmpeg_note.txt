ffmpeg中tbc tbr tbn代表的含义：

tbn is the time base in AVStream that has come from the container, I
think. It is used for all AVStream time stamps.

tbc is the time base in AVCodecContext for the codec used for a
particular stream. It is used for all AVCodecContext and related time
stamps.

tbr is guessed from the video stream and is the value users want to see
when they look for the video frame rate, except sometimes it is twice
what one would expect because of field rate versus frame rate.
